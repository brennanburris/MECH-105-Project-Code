# LU Factorization with Partial Pivoting Algorithm Description

This function takes an input of an array and factors it into Lower and Upper triangular matrices. This code is still in progress. It will work with
3x3 matrices, but nothing bigger.

This code works by using the functions associated with LU Factorization. It will index your numbers for you and output L U and P matrices.
