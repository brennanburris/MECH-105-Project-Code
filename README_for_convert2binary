#convert2binary Description

This code converts base ten to binary. The only input is a base ten number and is called with the syntax "convert2binary(input)". The code is
fairly bulletproof and I have not been able to break it yet. If you end up using it and have an issue, feel free to get in contact with me so
I can fix it. 

The code works by finding the remainder of the input divided by the base number, 2. The input becomes the floor, and the remainder is indexed
in and array of ones and zeros.
