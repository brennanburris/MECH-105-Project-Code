# Linear Regression Code Description

This code is used to find the slope, r^2, and y intercept values given a range of data. The only inputs it needs are 
two tables of dependant and independant variables. If the input sizes are not the same, it will create an error. The 
code automatically calculates slope, y intercept, and the r^2 value of the line of best fit.
