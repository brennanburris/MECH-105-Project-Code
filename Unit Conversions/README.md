# Description for eV2Joules Calculator 

This algorithm will switch Joules to electron volts and vice versa. The function require an input in either eV or J and which unit you choose to 
convert to. The variable ev is used to decide this. If ev = 1, the number will be converted to ev, and if ev = 0, the number will be converted 
to Joules. The output will be your number converted to your unit of choice.

This code works very well, it's simple and easy to use and I have not had a problem with it.
